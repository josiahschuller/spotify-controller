# Spotify Controller

Goal: Control my Spotify through a website.

The site can be found [here](https://josiahschuller.github.io/spotify-controller/index.html).

You can log-in using your Client ID and Client Secret. Don't forget to add `https://josiahschuller.github.io/spotify-controller/index.html` and `https://josiahschuller.github.io/spotify-controller/controller.html` as redirect URIs in your Spotify API dashboard.

Alternatively, you can log-in to my account using my password.

To run the code locally:
1. Install dependencies

    `npm install -g bower`
    
    `bower install crypto-js`

2. Open `index.html`
