# Spotify Controller

Goal: Control my Spotify through a website.

The site can be found [here](https://josiahschuller.github.io/spotify-controller/src/index.html).

You can log-in using your own Spotify account or, if you know my password, you can log-in to my account.

To run the code locally:
1. Install dependencies

    `npm install -g bower`
    
    `bower install crypto-js`

2. Open `src/index.html`
